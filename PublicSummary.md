## **Theory Behind Carbon Taxes** ##


Greenhouse gas emissions from human sources are the primary driver of climate change, which has led to biodiversity loss, rising sea levels, and increased natural disasters (Banholzer, Kossin, and Donner 2014; Habibullah et al. 2022). To reduce carbon emissions and address the source of climate change, many governments have implemented carbon taxes. A carbon tax imposes a fee on carbon emissions, charging polluters for each tonne of carbon they release into the atmosphere (Naef 2024). These fees make carbon-containing products more expensive, incentivizing consumers and businesses to switch to greener alternatives.
