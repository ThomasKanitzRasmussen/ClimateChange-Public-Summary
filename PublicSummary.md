# Executive Public Summary 

## **Theory Behind Carbon Taxes** ##


Greenhouse gas emissions from human sources are the primary driver of climate change, which has led to biodiversity loss, rising sea levels, and increased natural disasters (Banholzer, Kossin, and Donner 2014; Habibullah et al. 2022). To reduce carbon emissions and address the source of climate change, many governments have implemented carbon taxes. A carbon tax imposes a fee on carbon emissions, charging polluters for each tonne of carbon they release into the atmosphere (Naef 2024). These fees make carbon-containing products more expensive, incentivizing consumers and businesses to switch to more sustainable alternatives.


## **Carbon Tax in Canada and Globally**


Since 2019, every Canadian province and territory has implemented a carbon tax (Government of Canada 2024). Unlike other forms of taxation, this tax is structured to be revenue-neutral, meaning that the funds collected are returned directly to individuals and businesses through rebates. This has allowed many countries, including Canada, to get closer to reaching their emission reduction goals without causing substantial harm to the economy (Figure 1). As of 2024, 30 countries have adopted carbon taxes, making them a key tool in the global fight against climate change (World Bank 2024). However, implementing carbon taxes can create economic and social disparities. Low- and middle-income households may lack access to sustainable options like electric vehicles or energy-efficient appliances, due to their high costs. This forces individuals to pay higher prices for everyday goods without leading to emission reductions. While rebates and subsidies can help alleviate these impacts, they are often underpublicized, and many citizens remain unaware of these programs (Mildenberger et al. 2022).

## **Improving the Canadian Carbon Tax**

To enhance the effectiveness of carbon taxes, they can be combined with cap-and-trade policies (Arjmand et al. 2024). In a cap-and-trade model, the government sets a maximum allowable level of emissions (the cap) and provides allowances to different industries within that limit. Companies can then trade these allowances, buying or selling them as needed. Over time, this cap is gradually lowered to meet emission reduction targets. Together, these mechanisms set a baseline tax across sectors and directly limit how much companies can pollute. Additionally, allocating a portion of carbon tax revenue toward funding green infrastructure and grants for households to adopt sustainable practices can provide more options for individuals and businesses seeking to lower emissions (Gugler, Haxhimusa, and Liebensteiner 2023).


## **Recommendations**

Carbon taxes are a promising solution to climate change, but effective implementation is key. Region-specific plans are vital to the success of this solution as political, economic and behavioural uncertainty make it ineffective to base carbon taxes solely around one model. However, with comprehensive design, carbon taxes offer a promising path toward a low-carbon future. Three optimal methods to increase the efficacy of a carbon tax are: (1) a direct and well-communicated rebate to citizens, (2) a program of loans and grants to fund home and business energy efficiency improvements, and (3) a hybrid implementation of a cap-and-trade system with a carbon tax.
